<h1 style="text-align:center;">Farkle Rules</h1>
<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>The objective of the game is to score 10000 points to win.</p>

<h3>Gameplay</h3>
<p>The game is played with six dice. At the beginning each player rolls all dice.
    After each roll, the player is required to set aside (lock) at least one scoring dice.
    Then the player has to decide to either bank the accumulated current turn score,
    or continue rolling the dice.
    If a player has scored all six dice (<strong>Hot Dice</strong>), he can again roll six dice
    and continue accumulating scores for the turn.
    The player must have at least one scoring dice after each roll,
    otherwise they <strong>Farkle</strong> and lose all scores accumulated for the turn.
    It does not affect scores accumulated in previous turns.</p>
<p>Once a player has decided to end turn or has Farkled, the turn is passed to the next player,
    who plays according to the same rules.</p>
<p>The first player to score 10000 points wins the game.</p>

<p>Scores are only calculated for locked dice after last roll.
    It does't count dice which were locked and have already been scored in previous rolls .</p>
<p>For example, if a player gets two 1s and locks them, scoring 200.
    Then he gets another 1 in the next roll and locks it,
    it will only score a single 100, not 1000 for three 1s, so the total score would be 300.</p>
