<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>The objective of the game is to get as many points as possible by rolling five dice
and getting certain combinations.</p>

<h3>Gameplay</h3>
<p>In each turn, the player can roll the dice up to three times then chooses a scoring category,
although he may stop and score after the first or second roll.
After each roll, the player can choose the dice that he wants to keep by clicking on them,
so that they won't be changed in the next roll.
If the player doesn't want to keep a dice any more, click on it again.</p>
<p>There are totally 14 scoring categories, and the player must choose one in each turn.
Each category can be chosen only once.
If the player can't (or doesn't want to) enter a score, he must enter a zero.
The game ends when all the categories are chosen.
Scores are totalled, including any bonus points.</p>

<h3>Scoring</h3>
<p>The score card is divided into an Upper Section and a Lower Section.</p>

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Yahtzee</td>

<h4>Joker Rule</h4>
<p>If the player gets a combination of all five dice of the same number,
and Yahtzee and the corresponding category in Upper Section have already been chosen,
then he can score in any open categories in Lower Section,
although this doesn't meet the normal requirement of there categories at all.</p>
<p>For example, you roll five Fours, and you've chosen the "4" and "Yahtzee" categories,
then you can score 40 points in "Large Straight" (if not chosen yet).</p>
