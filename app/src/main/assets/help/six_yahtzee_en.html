<h1 style="text-align:center;">6-dice Yahtzee Rules</h1>
<p>The basic rules are the same as 5-dice Yahtzee except that six dice are used
and there are totally 20 scoring categories, and scoring rules are somewhat different.</p>

<h4>Joker Rule</h4>
<p>If the player gets a combination of all six dice of the same number,
and Yahtzee and the corresponding category in Upper Section have already been chosen,
then he can score in any open categories in Lower Section,
although this doesn't meet the normal requirement of there categories at all.
At this time, the scoring rules of all categories are changed to total of all dice,
except "Small Straight", "Large Straight" and "Full Straight".</p>
<p>For example, you roll six Sixes, and you've chosen the "6" and "Yahtzee" categories,
then you can score 36 points in "1 pair" or 21 points in "Full Straight" (if not chosen yet).</p>
